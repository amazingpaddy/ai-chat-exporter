# Gemini Chat Exporter

Gemini Chat Exporter is a Chrome Extension that allows you to export your entire Gemini chat conversation to a well-formatted Markdown file with a single click.

## Features

- Export your full Gemini chat history to Markdown, preserving formatting (code, tables, LaTeX, etc.)
- Dedicated "Export Chat" button appears automatically on every Gemini chat page
- Robust export logic: loads all chat history, copies perfectly formatted responses, and removes Gemini citation markers
- No build step required
- Open source under the Apache License 2.0

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release**
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/amazingpaddy/gemini-chat-exporter/releases) page
   - Download the `gemini-chat-exporter.zip` file from the latest release
   - Unzip the file to a folder on your computer

2. **Load the extension in Chrome**
   - Open `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you unzipped the extension files

3. **You're done!**
   - The "Export Chat" button will now appear on every Gemini chat page

## Usage

1. Go to [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and open any chat
2. Click the "Export Chat" button at the top right of the page (it will not overlap your profile icon)

4. A Markdown file (`gemini_chat_export.md`) will be downloaded automatically with your full chat history

## Permissions

This extension requires clipboard access permission (`clipboardRead`) in order to copy Gemini responses using the built-in copy button. This is necessary for exporting perfectly formatted chat content.
